  <h3>Gap analysis</h3>

    <p>This document is pointed to by a separate document, <a href="../gap-analysis/laoo-gap.html">Lao Gap Analysis</a>, which describes gaps in support for Lao on the Web, and prioritises and describes the impact of those gaps on the user.</p>
<p>Wherever an unsupported feature is indentified through the gap analysis process, the requirements for that feature need to be documented. This  document is where those requirements are described.</p>
<p>This document should contain no reference to a particular technology. For example, it should not say &quot;CSS does/doesn't do such and such&quot;, and it should not describe how a technology, such as CSS, should implement the requirements. It is technology agnostic, so that it will be evergreen, and it simply describes how the script works. The gap analysis document is the appropriate place for all kinds of technology-specific information.</p>

    <p>The document <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/">International text layout and typography index</a> (known informally as the text layout index) points to this document and others, and provides a central location for developers and implementers to find information related to various scripts.</p>
<p>The W3C also maintains a tracking system that  has links to github issues in W3C repositories. There are separate links for (a) requests from developers to the user community for information about how scripts/languages work, (b) issues raised against a spec, and (c) browser bugs.  For example, you can find out <a href="http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=type-info-request">what information developers are currently seeking</a>, and the resulting list can also be filtered by script.</p>

<section id="h_script_overview">
  <h2>Lao Script Overview</h2>
    <p>Lao is an alphabet. This means that it is phonetic in nature, where each letter represents a basic sound.</p>
<p>The script was originally an abugida, but since the script reforms leading up to 1960 it has been alphabetic. The syllable is the unit for various aspects of the behaviour of the script. Lao is a tonal language, and the script is designed to reflect tonal information.</p>
<p>The alphabet is split into vowels and consonants. The consonants are grouped into classes that affect the default tonal behaviour of a syllable. There are no independent vowels. Where there is no consonant to support a vowel sign, the character ອ [U+0EAD LAO LETTER O] is used as a support. Vowel signs are typically used in combinations to form the vowel sounds of a syllable. </p>
<p>Words are not separated by spaces. Text runs horizontally, left to right.</p>
<p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/lao/">Lao script summary</a> can be read for a high level overview of characters used for the script, and some basic features.</p>

      <h3>Emphasis &amp; highlighting</h3>
      <p class="prompt">Bold and italic are not always appropriate for expressing emphasis, and some scripts have their own unique ways of doing it, that are not in the Western tradition at all.

  <section id="h_lines_and_paragraphs">
<h2>Lines and Paragraphs</h2>

    <section id="h_line_breaking">
      <h3>Line breaking</h3>
<p>Although Lao doesn't use spaces or dividers between words, the expectation is that line-breaks occur at word boundaries.</p>
<p>Unlike Thai or Khmer, it is fairly straightforward to parse individual syllables in Lao, because its alphabetic nature makes it possible to identify syllable-final consonants. (Note that syllable wrapping must include any syllable-initial clusters involving h or l.)</p>
<p>While nearly all syllables can be argued to be words in their own right, there is still a preference for keeping multi-syllabic words (eg. <span lang="lo">ປະເທດ</span> <span class="trans">pa thēt</span> <span class="meaning">country</span>) together when wrapping text to the next line. For this, an application typically needs to use a dictionary to parse Lao text.</p>
<p>However, widely used software automatically inserts ​ <span class="uname">U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE</span> (ZWSP) in Lao text at word or syllable boundaries, and many web pages use such inserted ZWSP characters to get browsers to wrap correctly.</p>
<p>If a dictionary fails to keep two or more syllables together as needed, it should be possible to use the Unicode character <span class="uname">U+2060 WORD JOINER</span> between the two syllables. This is an invisible character, equivalent to a zero-width no-break space, and used to prevent line-breaks.</p>
<p><em>Other ideas to consider:</em></p>
<p class="issue">Also &quot;Some writers are beginning to use optional hyphens for syllable boundaries within words, which helps readability at line breaks.&quot; (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/sealreq/issues/3#issuecomment-385837202">@jmdurdin</a>)</p>
<p class="issue">&quot;One other difference from Thai is that European style punctuation (period, comma) is much more widely used in Lao than in Thai, with the consequence that traditional spaced phrase punctuation is now often incorrectly used, with spaces sometimes inserted within words.&quot; (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/sealreq/issues/3#issuecomment-385837202">@jmdurdin</a>)</p>

      <h3>Hyphenation</h3>

If hyphenation is used, where should the hyphen appear? <a href="index#hyphenation">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/typography/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ahyphenation%20label%3Ainfo-req">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <section id="h_justification">
      <h3>Justification &amp; line-end alignment</h3>
      <p class="prompt"> Is it normal to have flush lines down both sides of the text body (ie. full justification)? If so, what rules are used by the script to resolve the positioning of characters on a line? Does the script conform to a grid pattern? 
        Does your script allow punctuation to hang outside the text box at the start or end of a line? Where adjustments are need to make a line flush, how is that done? Do you shrink/stretch space between words and/or letters? Are word baselines stretched, as in Arabic? <a href="index#justification">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/typography/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ajustification%20label%3Ainfo-req">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

It is also defined explicitly in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-counter-styles-3/#simple-numeric">CSS Counter Styles specification</a>.</p>
<p>Counters are used to number lists, chapter headings, etc. Lao uses a numeric counter style, based on the decimal model, and using the standard Lao digits.</p>
